# Mus2Vid: The Pivot!

This is the Github project containing all code pertaining to Mus2Vid's pivot, starting in Spring 2025.

## How to run

TLDR: run the 'newApproachImage.py' file to generate a 'slideshow' video. 

Other files don't have functional code *yet*.

The 'input' and 'output' folders contain input songs (mp3 files) and output videos (generated by the 'newApproachImage.py' pipeline).

## Important Format to Follow

You'll notice that most scripts have a multi-line comment at the top, explaining what the script is about, its purpose, etc. 

Please do the same for files you create, it will help us all out. By the same token, please comment your code so that others know what different lines do.

## Testing

You will also notice there are folders for each of us in the 'testing' folder. Here is where we want you to add your own code when you test things out, before directly adding code to the main pipeline.
